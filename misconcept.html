                    <li>"I cannot resume normal activities" - You can resume all your normal activities, though you're asked to refrain.
                    <li>"I will have low blood" - If you are okayed to donate by the doctor you will still have surplus blood after the donation.
                    <li>"I can't take alcohol..." - You can on the next day.
                    <li>"It will be painful while donating" - No, you will not feel any pain.

                    <li>"I may get AIDS!" - No! Make sure disposable syringes are used and all measures are taken to keep you germ free.
                    <li>"My blood is common. I don't think there will be demand for it" - That is why the demand for your type is greater than for rare types.
